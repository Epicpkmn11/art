OpenUtau cover of MystSaphyr's [Retrospectre][retrospectre] translated
to [toki pona][tokipona].

- `.ustx` files are from [OpenUtau][openutau] using [Defoko][utau]
- `.rpp` files are from [REAPER][reaper]
- `.ass` files are from [Aegisub][aegisub]

Note: `Retrospectre - Off Vocal.wav` can be acquired from the description
      of the original video

This was based on the USTX from [my Teto cover](../retrospectre/), which in
turn was based on the USTs provided by MystSaphyr with the original video, but
translated to toki pona and switched back to Defoko lol

I'm not super great at toki pona, so figure there are probably a few mistakes
at least, but hopefully it's not too bad.
