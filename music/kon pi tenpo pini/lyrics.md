The left column is the original lyrics, middle is my translation, and right is
what my translation is intended to mean. The re-translation is not intended to
exactly match with a literal translation from toki pona back to English, but
hopefully it's fairly close and there's not anything too blatantly wrong.

I'm sure there's plenty of (slightly?) weird wordings from having to squeeze
everything into the right amount of syllables and match the melody, but
hopefully I've done a decent job overall, this is the first time I've actually
attempted to translate a song.

[^1]: The original lyric is "wide asleep, fast awake" which is rather weird
      to translate as, well, toki pona doesn't just have spare adjectives lying
      around for use specifically for intensifying asleep and awake respectively
      to swap around lol

      My translation is definitely a bit weird, but the original lyric is weird
      too. My intent is to contradict the first part with the second, or perhaps
      even like self-correction in a chat, as that fits to me

      I think "mi lape pona, ala pona" might work better, but 4 syllables do
      *not* fit well.
[^2]: Kinda unsure of 'sona sin' makes sense, in my mind it's 'newly learned
      about' -> 'newly met'
[^3]: This pair was tricky to fit the syllables lol
[^4]: A literal translation (mi jo e ilo loje pakala) fits too lol, but doesn't
      make sense

      This was rather tricky but I think it works
[^5]: This part was really tricky due to both me finding it hard to translate
      and a tricky syllable structure/melody...

      I think I've managed something decent but this was definitely the
      hardest part for me, spent forever on it
[^6]: Repetition of a previous line
