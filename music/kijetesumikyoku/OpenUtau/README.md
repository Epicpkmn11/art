OpenUtau doesn't (currently) allow changing the tempo mid-song, so I had to split to a different USTX every time the tempo changed... and this song had quite a few tempo changes.

There are a couple tempo changes where I just did the math and manually extended the notes when it was just like the last note and was strongly connected to the previous note.

All except 9 can be played using only Kasane Teto's VCV (『連続音』+『単独音』) voicebank, 9 is mostly VCV however I used the CVVC (English) voicebank for the Lojban part.
